Q. Why SessionFactory is a HeavyWeigth Object?
==>> Session factory objects are to be implemented using the singleton design pattern. 
Instances of SessionFactory are thread-safe and typically shared throughout an application. 
As these objects are heavy weight because they contains the connection information, hibernate 
configuration information and mapping files,location path. So creating number of instances will
 make our application heavy weight. But the session objects are not thread safe. So in short 
 it is - SessionFactory objects are one per application and Session objects are one per client.
